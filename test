                <p>Procuret makes money by adding a margin to the invoice
                    value. Depending on the arrangements Procuret makes with
                    the supplier, this margin is included in the monthly
                    payments you make. Or, they form part of the fee paid
                    by the supplier.
                </p>
                <p>The payments we receive from you over the course of the
                    Procuret instalment term go toward meeting the obligations
                    we have to our staff, running the Procuret business,
                    compliance, funding and the ongoing development of Procuret

                <p>Procuret is perfect for purchases where it makes complete
                    sense to pay for over time rather than upfront. For example
                    if you purchase an annual software licence or an asset that
                    provides you business a long term benefit, it makes sense
                    to match the payments to the benefit term.</p>
                <p>Paying with Procuret allows you to preserve cash and maintain
                    working capital. If you’re making a really large purchase
                    for your business ($50,000+), we recommend speaking with a
                    traditional lender.</p>

                <p>Your
                    installments do not start until you approve the purchase
                    or service - it's one of the ways we try look out for our
                    business customers. If you are not happy with your
                    purchase, do not approve installments to commence
                    (obviously!). Rather, speak with the supplier directly to
                    arrange a solution.</p>
                <p>If something goes
                    wrong, whilst we have policies and procedures to review
                    suppliers, we also rely on the process that you have gone 
                    through to get comfortable with the supplier (just like you
                    would with any purchase you make), and the purchase that
                    you’ve chosen. You must contact your supplier to arrange a
                    solution. In the meantime our system will continue to
                    collect your instalments as per our agreement. If you have
                    any questions, please contact us here.

                    If there is a chance that you will miss a payment, please

                    Procuret has attempted to direct debit your account, then a
                    dishonour fee of $10 applies; this covers the cost of
                    re-running the payment and processing charges incurred. The
                    payment will be attempted again the next day. If the payment
                    remains unpaid, there is a 0.09% per day late charge
                    calculated against the balance of your Procuret Plan for
                    each day the payment remains outstanding. It is always best

            <p>Procuret is a Business to Business (B2B) payment platform.
                Requesting your ABN allows the instalments to be in the name of
                the business rather than you as an individual. Procuret
                assesses the eligibility of your businesses using your ABN
                and other provided data.
